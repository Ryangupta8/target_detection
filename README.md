# Target Detection package for ROS

## Overview

This is a ROS package developed for **Target object detection** using RGB-D camera.

It is assumed that we have pre-trained Object detection system such as YOLO or OpenPose.


## Dependencies

### Azure Kinect SDK
If you want to use Azure Kinect as RGBD camera, you should install Kinect SDK.

Please follow instrunctios from https://github.com/microsoft/Azure-Kinect-Sensor-SDK



### YOLO

Pleae follow instructions from https://github.com/leggedrobotics/darknet_ros

For more information about YOLO, Darknet, available training data and training YOLO see the following link: [YOLO: Real-Time Object Detection](http://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/).
